# ResNet18-Evaluation-PyTorch

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet18 model using PyTorch for binary classification. This model is adapted to identify images in two classes: Positive and Negative.

## Results
The model had over 99% accuracy in binary classification.
It identified misclassified samples to further strengthen its capabilities.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

In Docker and JupyterLab

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lucianoscarpaci/ResNet18-Evaluation-PyTorch.git
```
